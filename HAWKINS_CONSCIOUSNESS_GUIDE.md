## THE CRITICAL LINE: 200 (Courage)

> **Below 200** = SURVIVAL PARADIGM (Force-based, defensive, reactive)
> **Above 200** = REASON & INTEGRITY (Power-based, open, proactive)

### Sales Application:
- If lead is **below 200**: They're in survival mode. Fear, anger, pride are dominant. They will resist, deflect, and distrust.
- If lead is **above 200**: They can reason. Logic, benefits, and value propositions work.
- If lead is **above 400**: They're open. Trust is established. Focus on alignment, not persuasion.

## HUD Integration

### Real-Time Consciousness Meter
Instead of just "sentiment", show a **vertical gauge from 20-600** with the lead's current estimated level.

### Threshold Alert
When lead drops **below 200**, flash warning: "SURVIVAL MODE - Rebuild trust before pitching"

### Prompts Based on Level
| Current Level | Suggested Action |
|---------------|------------------|
| < 100 (Fear/Grief) | "Back off. Ask about their concerns." |
| 100-199 (Anger/Pride) | "Validate their position. Don't argue." |
| 200-300 (Courage/Neutrality) | "Logic works. Present facts." |
| 300-400 (Willingness/Reason) | "They're ready. Make the ask." |
| 400+ (Love/Joy) | "Match their energy. Align values." |
