## X. DIAGNOSTIC PROBES (Subtext Elicitors)
**Purpose**: Questions where the *answer doesn't matter* — it's HOW they respond that reveals their emotional state.

| Probe Question | What It Reveals | Interpretation |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| "Am I making sense so far?" | Engagement | Long pause = lost, Quick "yes" = following |
| "How does that sound?" | Approval | Enthusiasm = good, Flat = objection brewing |
| "Is this the kind of thing you were looking for?" | Interest | "Exactly!" = hot, "I guess" = cold |
| "Are you still with me?" | Attention | Annoyance = lost them, "Yeah definitely" = engaged |
| "Does that make sense?" | Confusion | "Kind of" = confused, "Absolutely" = clear |
| "What do you think about that?" | Opinion | Silence = processing/negative, Quick response = engaged |
| "You're a smart guy, you probably know this already" | Ego/Comfort | Agree = relaxed, Deflect = guarded |

### How to Use:
1. AI detects attention dropping or silence extending
2. HUD suggests a **Diagnostic Probe**
3. Agent asks the question
4. AI analyzes the *tone and timing* of response
5. Updates metrics (Attention, Interest, Hawkins Level)

### HUD Display:
```
🔍 PROBE: "Am I making sense so far?"
   └─ Listen for: speed, enthusiasm, hesitation
```
