## Behavior Indicators (Live Detection)

| Indicator | Meaning | HUD Display |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Increased Blink Rate** | Stress, discomfort | 🔴 "Stress detected" |
| **Decreased Blink Rate** | Deep focus, processing | 🟢 "Focused" |
| **Lip Compression** | Withheld opinion | ⚠️ "They're holding back" |
| **Lip Retraction** | Need for reassurance | 💡 "Offer validation" |
| **Facial Line Changes** | Emotional shift | Alert on direction change |

## Linguistic Techniques (Prompts)

| Technique | Example Prompt |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Identity Agreement** | "You seem like someone who really values quality over price..." |
| **Statements > Questions** | Use "Tell me about your budget situation" not "What's your budget?" |
| **Priming** | "Most successful companies I work with..." (prime them to want to be successful) |
| **Embedded Commands** | "...and you'll *feel confident* about this decision" |
| **"My Friend John"** | "I had a client last week who was in the exact same situation..." |

## Authority Signals (Agent Rating)

| Signal | How to Rate |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pace/Speed** | Speaking slower = more authority |
| **Tone** | Calm, measured = confidence |
| **Posture** | (Future: video analysis) |
| **Open Palms** | Non-threatening, builds trust |

## HUD Implementation Priority

1. **Blink/Stress Indicator** - Requires video feed (future)
2. **Linguistic Prompts** - Can implement NOW (text-based)
3. **Identity Agreements** - Pre-generate based on lead profile
4. **"My Friend John" Stories** - Library of case studies to reference
5. **Pace Coaching** - "Slow down" alerts

## Key Insight

> "Mirroring emotional and cognitive states is more impactful than simply mirroring body language."

This means the AI should detect WHAT the lead is feeling and suggest the agent match that energy — not just copy their gestures.
