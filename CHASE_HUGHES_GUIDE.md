## CORE FRAMEWORKS

### 1. FATE Model (Influence Architecture)
| Element | Description | HUD Application |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **F**ocus | Control their attention | Alert when lead is distracted |
| **A**uthority | Establish credibility | Rate agent's authority signals |
| **T**ribe | Create belonging | Find shared interests/identity |
| **E**motion | Trigger emotional response | Track emotional state changes |

### 2. 6-Minute X-Ray (Rapid Profiling)
Profile a person within 6 minutes by observing:
| Trait | What to Observe | Sales Impact |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Motivations** | What drives them? | Tailor pitch to their WHY |
| **Goals** | What do they want? | Show how you get them there |
| **Tendencies** | Action vs analysis? | Match your pace to theirs |
| **Social Needs** | Recognition? Security? | Address their core need |
| **Decision Style** | Fast/slow, logic/emotion | Adapt your close approach |

### 3. S-Factor (Subtle Signals)
Micro-behaviors that reveal internal state:
| Signal | Meaning | HUD Alert |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Blink rate increase** | Stress/anxiety | "They're stressed" |
| **Blink rate decrease** | Deep focus | "They're engaged" |
| **Lip compression** | Withholding opinion | "They're holding back" |
| **Lip retraction** | Needs reassurance | "Offer validation" |
| **Speech speed up** | Anxiety/excitement | Check context for which |
| **Speech slow down** | Processing/resistance | Give them space |

## LINGUISTIC TECHNIQUES

### Identity Influence (Most Powerful)
> "Influencing identity is more powerful than logical argument"

Instead of convincing them, make them BECOME the type of person who would buy.

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Identity Agreement** | "You seem like someone who values quality over cutting corners" |
| **Future Pacing** | "When you're using this and seeing results..." |
| **Presupposition** | "When we get started..." (not IF) |

### Statements Over Questions
Questions trigger resistance. Statements invite elaboration.

| Instead of... | Say... |
|--------------|--------|
| "What's your budget?" | "Tell me about your budget situation." |
| "Are you the decision maker?" | "Walk me through your decision process." |
| "Do you have concerns?" | "Share any thoughts on your mind." |

### "My Friend John" Technique
Tell a story about someone else to plant ideas without triggering defenses.

> "I had a client last week in your exact situation. They were worried about [objection], but then [positive outcome]..."

---

## INTERROGATION-DERIVED TECHNIQUES (Ethical Adaptation)

### Kindness Over Threats
> "Kindness and minimizing blame are more effective than threats"

| For Sales | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Reduce blame** | "It makes sense you'd be cautious" |
| **Validate concern** | "That's a smart question to ask" |
| **Give easy outs** | "If it's not right, no pressure" |

### Raising Stakes
Create urgency without lying:
- "I can only hold this price until Friday"
- "We're onboarding 3 companies this month"
- "My calendar fills up quickly"
